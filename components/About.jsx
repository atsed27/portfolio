          <h2 className="py-4">Who I Am</h2>
          <p className="py-2">
            I specialize in Full Stack Web and Application Development, along
            with UX/UI design. Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies
            and understand that there is more than one way to accomplish a task.
            I am a quick learner and can adapt to new tech stacks as needed. I
            believe that being a great developer is not about using a single
            language, but about choosing the best tool for the job.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2">
            While I am most proficient in building front-end applications using
            HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and I also
            have expertise in back-end development with Node.js, Express.js,
            Golang. Additionally, for mobile application development, I work
            with React Native. Since these technologies require databases, I
            have experience with both relational and non-relational database
            technologies, including MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2">
            I began my web development journey in 2018 during my first year of
            studying Computer Engineering. I have experience working directly
            with clients, transforming mock wireframes into fully deployed
            applications.
